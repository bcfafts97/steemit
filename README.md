# steemit
I have two suggestions to make on the Steemit site. The first one is

#### Who Viewed my post
***
I am pretty sure everyone would like to know who viewed their post and not the number of people who did. That way we know how and who would relate with and build a long-lasting relationship with. I am always curious who viewed my post, Did bots view it or maybe a whale I aspire to be like just went through my post![IMG_20180105_092352_052.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1515141332/ygzsfukg0c4oslq08o2c.jpg)

#### Voting Power 
***
Steemit should add the voting power percentage left for users. That way we would easily know how to manage our voting power rather than using other site to check what's left of our voting power.

It can be placed near the reputation digit

### Choosing How much Power I want in an Upvote
***
At one point using the Steemit site, I was able to choose what percentage I wanna upvote a post but that privilege isnt there anymore. users should be able to choose how much percentage they wanna upvote a post (minnows also have a right , *Right to Vote and its attributes*).
